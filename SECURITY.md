# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Albatha Real Estate website to ensure maximum protection against common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Security Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin - Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive APIs (camera, microphone, geolocation)
- **X-DNS-Prefetch-Control**: off - Prevents DNS prefetching
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS with HSTS
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Comprehensive CSP to prevent XSS attacks

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Zod Schema Validation**: Type-safe validation for all form inputs
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters and normalizes input
- **HTML Sanitization**: Uses DOMPurify to clean HTML content
- **XSS Protection**: Escapes HTML entities to prevent script injection
- **Length Limits**: Enforces maximum length limits on all inputs

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse from single IP addresses
- **Endpoint-specific Limits**: Different limits for different API endpoints
- **Time-window Based**: 15-minute sliding window for rate limiting
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes expired rate limit entries

### 4. API Security
- **Secure API Routes**: Protected endpoints with validation and rate limiting
- **Request Validation**: All API requests are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **Method Restrictions**: Only allowed HTTP methods for each endpoint

### 5. Form Security
- **Client-side Validation**: Real-time validation with user feedback
- **Server-side Validation**: Double validation on the server
- **CSRF Protection**: Form tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery
- **Input Sanitization**: All form inputs are sanitized before processing

### 6. Security Monitoring
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitors for suspicious activities
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual patterns in user behavior
- **Alert System**: Logs security events for analysis

### 7. Data Protection
- **Input Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- **Secure Storage**: Data is stored securely with proper access controls
- **Data Validation**: All data is validated before processing
- **Privacy Protection**: User data is handled according to privacy standards

## Security Configuration

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
RATE_LIMIT: {
  WINDOW_MS: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  MAX_REQUESTS: 100, // Max requests per window
  CONTACT_FORM_LIMIT: 5, // Max contact form submissions per window
  NEWSLETTER_LIMIT: 3, // Max newsletter subscriptions per window
}
```

### Input Validation
```typescript
VALIDATION: {
  MAX_NAME_LENGTH: 50,
  MAX_EMAIL_LENGTH: 100,
  MAX_PHONE_LENGTH: 20,
  MAX_SUBJECT_LENGTH: 100,
  MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH: 1000,
  MIN_MESSAGE_LENGTH: 10,
}
```

### Security Patterns
The system monitors for and blocks:
- XSS attempts (script injection, event handlers)
- SQL injection patterns
- Command injection attempts
- Directory traversal attacks
- Suspicious form submissions

## API Endpoints

### Contact Form API (`/api/contact`)
- **Method**: POST
- **Rate Limit**: 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Validation**: Full form validation with Zod schemas
- **Security**: Input sanitization, XSS protection, rate limiting

### Newsletter API (`/api/newsletter`)
- **Method**: POST
- **Rate Limit**: 3 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Validation**: Email validation with Zod schemas
- **Security**: Input sanitization, duplicate prevention, rate limiting

## Security Monitoring

### Monitored Events
- Page loads and navigation
- Form submissions
- Rate limit violations
- Validation failures
- Suspicious content detection
- Rapid clicking patterns
- Console errors
- DevTools access attempts

### Logging
All security events are logged with:
- Timestamp
- IP address
- User agent
- Event details
- Severity level

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at multiple levels
3. **Output Encoding**: Properly encode all outputs
4. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information leakage
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive security logging
6. **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
7. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS
8. **Headers**: Security headers for browser protection
9. **CSP**: Content Security Policy for XSS prevention
10. **HTTPS**: Enforced secure connections

## Security Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- `zod`: Schema validation
- `isomorphic-dompurify`: HTML sanitization
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken`: JWT token handling

### Development Dependencies
- `@types/bcryptjs`: TypeScript types for bcryptjs
- `@types/jsonwebtoken`: TypeScript types for jsonwebtoken

## Deployment Security

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in production:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Server Configuration
- Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Set up proper firewall rules
- Enable security monitoring and alerting

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Input validation testing
- Rate limiting testing
- XSS prevention testing
- SQL injection prevention testing

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing
- Security audit
- Code review
- Vulnerability assessment

## Incident Response

### Security Event Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring detects security events
2. **Analysis**: Security events are analyzed for severity
3. **Response**: Appropriate response based on event severity
4. **Logging**: All responses are logged for analysis
5. **Review**: Regular review of security events and responses

### Escalation Procedures
- **Low**: Log and monitor
- **Medium**: Log, monitor, and alert
- **High**: Immediate response and investigation
- **Critical**: Immediate response, investigation, and notification

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Regular security audits
- Update security configurations as needed

### Monitoring
- Monitor security logs regularly
- Review rate limiting effectiveness
- Analyze security event patterns
- Update security rules based on new threats
